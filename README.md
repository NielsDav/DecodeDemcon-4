**Instructions on how to run the code:**

To generate the schedule, run main.py
The output should be a 'Shows per stage' summary, and a more visual tabular output, with clear scheduling of the shows per stage.

Make sure the dataset is named 'show_data.txt' and in same root folder as main.py
(see included data_set file, which is copied from the challenge information page)


**Note:**
For large datasets, the additional fancy tabular output may wrap in the console/terminal, creating a not-so-fancy looking output. Copying the output to another editor of choice may help (and diable text wrapping)
For me outputs up to 50 'hours' worked well when using a maximum terminal, spanning the whole screen width (2.7k monitor)

Code should be able to run using Python 3.12.5.
Used libraries may need to be installed:
    - csv (to read data set)
    - prettytable (to generate good-looking tabular output)

Have fun reviewing!
